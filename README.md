Hi all. Taking a cue from spoon and a similar project by Agonlitgh I have created an alpha version of a program written in C++ with LLV-MOS to create TilesMaps (mappers). I know, I have a wicked imagination :-) .
The software loads a graphics file that contains tiles and you can create maps with these tiles.
Use the cursor to move into map and space to draw the select tile. To change the tiles use the key indicate near the tiles box. 
'<' and '>' change the tiles page. Every page has 26 tiles.
Mapper allows you to save and load the created maps in binary format that can be used directly. I have created an example in basic for loading them. 
There are still many functions to be created, for example for now the map file is fixed (map0.map) as well as the graphics file name (graphics.gfx), and others.
I will continue with the development in the coming weeks.
